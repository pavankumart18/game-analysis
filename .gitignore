# (Optional: If user wants to commit output usage, remove *.txt/*.json, but usually data is ignored)
# The user only asked for checkpoints and venv. I will keep outputs but ignore models.
# Re-reading request: "add gitignore file for checkpoints and venv"
# I should stick to what they asked + standard python cleanliness.
# I will NOT ignore .json/.txt unless standard.
# But large video files definitely ignore.
